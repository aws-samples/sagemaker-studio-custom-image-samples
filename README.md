## SageMaker Studio Custom Image Samples

### Overview

This repository contains examples of Docker images that are valid custom images for KernelGateway Apps in SageMaker Studio. These custom images enable you to bring your own packages, files, and kernels for use with notebooks, terminals, and interactive consoles within SageMaker Studio.

### Examples

- [echo-kernel-image](examples/echo-kernel-image) - This example uses the echo_kernel from Jupyter as a "Hello World" introduction into writing custom KernelGateway images.
- [beakerx](examples/beakerx-image) - This example uses the `BeakerX` kernel see [BeakerX](http://beakerx.com/) which allows you to use  Java, Groovy, Scala,   Kotlin, Clojure languages.
- [jupyter-docker-stacks-julia-image](examples/jupyter-docker-stacks-julia-image) - This example leverages the Data Science image from Jupyter Docker Stacks to add a Julia kernel.
- [r-image](examples/r-image) - This example contains the `ir` kernel and a selection of R packages, along with the AWS Python SDK (boto3) and the SageMaker Python SDK which can be used from R using `reticulate`
- [rapids-image](examples/rapids-image) - This example uses the offical rapids.ai image from Dockerhub. Use with a GPU instance on Studio
- [scala-image](examples/scala-image) - This example adds a Scala kernel based on [Almond Scala Kernel](https://almond.sh/).
- [tf2.3-image](examples/tf23-image) - This examples uses the official TensorFlow 2.3 image from DockerHub and demonstrates bundling custom files along with the image.
#### One-time setup

All examples have a one-time setup to create an ECR repository

```
REGION=<aws-region>
aws --region ${REGION} ecr create-repository \
    --repository-name smstudio-custom
```
